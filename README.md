# Design

  ### Color Scheme
  - The main colors used will be black, gray, white, and a yellow variant (specifically, #F7DC6F).
  ### Typography
  - The font for the logo is Boogaloo from Google Fonts 
  - The font family used for this site will be Lato throughout the site, with San Serif as the fallback if such font family is not being imported. 
  ### Imagery 
  - Imagery is very important on this app. It will be used to appeal to dog owners specifically and feature a variety of dogs. The images will be professional and acquired from Unsplash. Product images are very important and will be featured with a white background in order to show as much detail. Because this is a fictitious company created for this project, professional products images have been acquired from various Amazon.com product pages.

# Defensive Design (Security Features)
Defensive design and security features have been achieved by:
- Utilizing inbuilt Django validation and authentication features
- Assigning a specific Staff status to each user and only allowing those users labeled as Staff access to product management site features
- Users must sign in to view order history and personal profile details
- Users cannot view other users' previous order history and personal information
- If a users tries to enter a url for a protected area of the site, the Django @login required decorator and superuser class will stop the action and flash a warning message stating that only store owners are allowed access to that area
- If a user tries to checkout with an empty shopping bag, a warning messages lets them know that there is nothing in their shopping bag
- Email fields with correct email structure are required fields for registering onto the site as a new user
- When registering as a new user, a visitor is required to enter email and password twice to ensure they enter information correctly
