# Design

  ### Color Scheme
  - The main colors used will be black, gray, white, and a yellow variant (specifically, #F7DC6F)
  ### Typography
  - The font for the logo is Boogaloo from Google Fonts 
  - The font family used for this site will be Lato throughout the site, with San Serif as the fallback if such font family is not being imported

Product images are very important and will be featured with a white background in order to show as much detail. Because this is a fictitious company created for this project, professional products images have been acquired from various Amazon.com product pages

# Database and Database Schema
Postgres is the database used for storing product categories, product details, userâ€™s profile details and previous order information. 
The schema is as follows:

<br/>
<br/>

# Defensive Design (Security Features)
Defensive design and security features have been achieved by:
- Utilizing inbuilt Django validation and authentication features
- Assigning a specific Staff status to each user and only allowing those users labeled as Staff access to product management site features
- Users must sign in to view order history and personal profile details
- Users cannot view other users' previous order history and personal information
- If a user tries to enter a url for a protected area of the site, the Django @login required decorator and superuser class will stop the action and flash a warning message stating that only store owners are allowed access to that area
- If a user tries to checkout with an empty shopping bag, a warning messages lets them know that there is nothing in their shopping bag
- Email fields with correct email structure are required fields for registering onto the site as a new user
- When registering as a new user, a visitor is required to enter email and password twice to ensure they enter information correctly

## Testing Responsiveness
### Responsiveness of the app was tested using Google Dev tools. The following issues were found and fixed accordingly:
| Issue Found  |  Fix Applied  |  Outcome  |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| When viewing in mobile phone view, Search, Account, and Shopping Bag links were pushed off center and distorted. | Changed and deleted class for div assigned to links. Applied boostrap classes to specific div. | Links and corresponding text on the side is properly aligned. |
| Heroku updated database and in the process changed the postgres database url causing data from local version sql database to not be transferred over to Heroku app on load data command. | Worked with tutor support to identify the issue. Deleted original json file containing database and dumped data once more into new db.json file. Copied new postgres database url to camp_rover/settings.py file and in Heroku Config Vars settings. Once again entered command to load data to Heroku app. | Data transfer was successful. |
| Some product images were broken during new data transfer from development version. | Reviewed image files in deployed app's admin panel and discovered that in data transfer some image file names were transferred over with random characters at the end of the file name, thereby breaking the link. Via the admin panel, manually changed each file name for images that were broken. | No broken images observed. |
| Deployed app loaded very slowly. | Reviewed image file sizes and discovered that Home page and About Us page images as well as some product images were too large. Used PicResize to resize those images, deleted original files from AWS S3 storage and replaced with smaller files. | App loads much faster. |
